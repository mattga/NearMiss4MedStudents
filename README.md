NearMiss
========
iOS App for conveniently and efficiently submitting "NearMiss" reports for UCI Medical Students. Project was
started during MedAppJam 2012, a 10 day iOS competition at University of California, Irvine.

What is a NearMiss?
An 'incident', or situation, where a mistake is made or almost made, but no harm is done.

Why?
* Takes only 15-20 seconds
* Improves compliance with near miss reporting, providing hospitals (or any field where incidents occur) with
  an effective and reliable system
* Prevents disruption of work-flow
* Improves patient safety
* Most importantly: "Saves lives, and saves time"

Future Plans
============
* Update of the UI for full iPad compatibility
* Custom UI with NearMiss color scheme
